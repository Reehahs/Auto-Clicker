# Auto-Clicker
An auto clicker script made for the game "Old School RuneScape" in the programming language python.

This program will require a python IDE in order to be used.

DISCLAIMER: If using this you get banned on Old School RuneScape, that is not my fault. This program was created for fun not to be used seriously.
